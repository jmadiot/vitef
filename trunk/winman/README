NAME

  winman - manual window tiling without mouse

SYNOPSIS
  
  winman OPTION

DESCRIPTION
  
  move and resize the active window, or toggle "always on top".
  
  OPTION is one of: left, right, up, down, ttop.
  
    left: 50% width, 100% height, left side.
    
    right: 50% width, 100% height, right side
    
    up: 75% width, 75% height, center
    
    down: 100% width, 25% height, bottom, activate "always on top"
    
    atop: toggle "always on top"

  Except for ttop and down, every call of winman cancel the "always on
  top" and "fullscreen" options.

DEPENDENCIES
  
  wmctrl, which is probably compatible with you window manager.  See
  http://tomas.styblo.name/wmctrl/ to be sure.
  
  wmctrl does not handle the up/down bar so I set it to my personal
  settings, so you may see some space at the bottom or hidden parts of
  your window at the top. You can change it by setting the variable
  $SPACE_BOTTOM is the source. In the future, this could be automatic.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

  Set as shortcut:

    sh /path/to/winman.sh OPTION

  I suggest Shift+Alt+[←,→,↑,↓], and "PageUp" for ttop.
